# Project Title

## Overview
This project is a template for a smart-dumb component architecture using React and TypeScript.

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: This is the main source directory containing all the application code.
  - `components/`: This folder contains reusable React components that can be used throughout the application.
    - `User/`: This subfolder contains components related to user management.
      - `UserList.tsx`: A dumb component that displays a list of users. It takes a `users` prop, which is an array of user objects, and renders each user's name in a list item.
  - `containers/`: This folder contains smart components that manage state and logic, often connecting to Redux or other state management solutions. They pass data to dumb components.
  - `hooks/`: This folder contains custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic, making it easier to share functionality across components.
  - `pages/`: This folder contains components that represent entire pages in the application, often composed of multiple containers and components.
  - `services/`: This folder contains functions that handle API calls and business logic, separating concerns from UI components.
  - `store/`: This folder contains the state management setup, such as Redux store configuration, actions, and reducers.

  - `App.tsx`: The main application component that integrates all other components and serves as the entry point for the React application.
  - `index.tsx`: The entry point of the application where the React app is rendered into the DOM.
